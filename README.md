PRODIGY_WD_03: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
This project is an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of the Prodigy Web Development Internship, Task 3. It allows two players to play against each other on a web browser, with clear game state tracking and win/draw conditions.

Features
Interactive Game Board: A 3x3 grid where players can click to place their markers.

Player Turn Tracking: The game clearly indicates whose turn it is (Player X or Player O).

Win Condition Detection: Automatically checks for winning combinations across rows, columns, and diagonals.

Draw Condition Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.

Game Reset: A button to easily reset the game and start a new round.

Visual Feedback: Cells change color on hover, and winning cells are highlighted with an animation.

Responsive Design: The game board and elements are styled to be visually appealing and playable on various screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the fundamental structure of the game, including the board, cells, and control buttons.

CSS: Used for styling the game board, cells, buttons, and implementing visual effects like hover states and win animations.

JavaScript: Powers the core game logic, including handling player clicks, updating the game state, checking for win/draw conditions, and managing player turns.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and consistent styling, ensuring a modern and clean look.
